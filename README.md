## Description:

Hello! This is my new personal website. A replacement of my previous website.

This website has a MySQL database to track page visits and link clicks. Other than that
this is just a personal website where I display various different types of information
about myself and other things like my projects and skills. Feel free to take a look around
my digital realm :)
